# CSS Basics

CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheet. This language works in coordination with HTML, but is its own language with its own rules and terminology. In contrast to HTML which is responsible for the content of the page, CSS is responsible for the presentation of the page.

Examples of what CSS can help you determine include:
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li> What background color you want the page or a paragraph to be. </li>
		<li> What font or font size you want for your headings or your normal text. </li>
		<li> How large you want the images, and whether you want them aligned center, left or right. </li>
	</ul>
</p>
