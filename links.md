# Links

Whether creating a menu to connect different pages of your website, or inserting links as references or options for more information, links are an important component of most websites, even your most basic.

The `<a>` tag, or anchor tag, creates the link to another document. You can use the `<a>` tag to link to other documents or webpages you created for the same site or to documents or webpages created by other web users. 

OPTION 1: Linking to your document

The following appears as a link to the `about.html` page on the same site: 

```
<a href="about.html">About</a>
```

On your webpage it will appear as:

[About](about.html)  

OPTION 2: Linking to other pages/sites

```
<a href="http://www.google.com">
```

On your webpage it will appears as:

<a href="http://www.google.com">


Each example above also includes `href`. `href`, short for hypertext reference, is an "attribute" which offers secondary information - in this case, offering the address of or navigation to the page being referenced.

There is another technical difference between the two options above. Option 1, or links that describe the URL in relation to the page you're on, are called 'relative' links. Option 2, or links that describe the URL as a separate entity and thus include the whole URL, are called 'absolute' links. 

Best Practice Tip: Use relative links when referring to pages on your own site. This will prevent links from breaking should you decide to move your site.

ACTIVITY:
Add the relative link to the About page to your `index.html` page. Re-save that document and re-open it in your broswer - you can refresh the page if you still have it open, or re-open it from your desktop.

Challenge: Add a relative link from your About page to your `index.html` page.
