# Activity: Style your HTLM

Similar to the closing HTML activity, there will be a set of challenges structuring the styling of their HTML.



<strong>Reminder</strong> that after creating a stylesheet, you must link it to your HTML document. You can do so with the `<link>` tag:

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
	
This will tell your HTML document to use styles from the text file named `style.css` in the same folder.
