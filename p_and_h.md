# Paragraphs and Headings

Paragraphs and headings are the main textual elements of the body of your html-based webpages. Because these contain content that you want to organize and display on your webpage, these are entered in the body element. 

The `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc tags denote headings and subheadings, `<h1>` being the largest.

THe `<p>` tags denote paragraphs, or blocks of text.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
	<title>A boring story</title>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>
		Cleaning my boiler
	</h1>
	<p>
	When I got to my basement that day, I knew that I just had to clean my boiler. It was just too dirty. Honestly, it was getting to be a hazard. So I got my wire brush and put on my most durable pair of boiler-cleaning overalls. It was going to be a long day.
	</p>
</body>

</html>
```

## Activity:
In you `index.html` file, add a title, header, and paragraph. Re-save the file. Go into your finder and open it.

What do you notice about how the information is organized? 

### Reminder: 
The `<head>` element is for information about the webpage. For example, the `<title>` in the template below will appear in the browser tab.
