# Tags and Elements

Tags and elements are the structuring components of a page. 

**Elements** identify the different parts of a page, such as paragraphs, headings, titles, body text, images and more. Elements are demarcated by tags which enclose the content of an element (ex. `<head>` and `<head>` are tags that denote the head section of your page).

**Tags** demarcate elements in one of two ways. As with the paragraph element below, an element can have an opening and a closing tag, with the content in between. 

	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Elements which have an opening and closing tag can have other elements inside them.

	<p>When I came home from school, I saw he had <strong>stolen</strong> my chocolate pudding.</p>

*Note: The `<strong>` tag indicates bolded text.*

Other elements have self-closing tags as with the image element below. These tags are also called **void tags** These elements don't require a separate closing tag, and these tags don't require a closing tag because you wouldn't add an element into this element.

If you look back at the basic template in your `index.html` file, you'll see that the main sections of your file have opening and closing tags. This is because each of these main elements contains a number of more specific elements, many of which we'll discuss today.
