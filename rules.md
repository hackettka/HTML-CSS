# Rule Sets

CSS is based on rules. Rule sets look like this:

```
h1 {
	color: orange;
	font-style: italic;
}
p {
	font-family: san serif
	font-style: normal
}
#navbar {
	background-color: yellow;
	padding: 80px
}
.intro {
	font-family: arial;
	background-color: grey;
	color: dark grey;
}
```

The first rule applies to all `<h1>` tags on each page where your HTML document links to your stylesheet, and changes the font style and display of those headings. 

The lines within the curly braces (i.e. `{ }`) are called **selectors**, and they change the formatting of the elements in the HTML document. Each selector ends in a semicolon (`;`).

Note the different syntax being used for the different rule sets. The bottom two are specific kinds of rule sets called **classes** and **ids**. In general, classes and ids allow for more specific styling - more on these soon! 

## ACTIVITY
Copy and paste the CSS above into your `style.css` file and re-save the file. Then open or refresh your `index.html` file in your browser and see what happens.  

<strong>What are some other selectors you might set for different HTML elements?</strong>
