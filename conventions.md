As we’ve gone through the different components of creating a webpage, you have likely picked on some conventions for creating a webpage using HTML. However, before proceeding, let's outline them.

    <ul>
        <li> Some tags are self-closing, while others require a closing tag. Self-closing tags are called void tags, and are generally self-closing because you wouldn't need or want to add another element within a tag </li>
        <li> Use lower case. There is no techical reason to do this, but it is good practice: easier to scan code, cleaner look. </li>
        <li> You code should be nested. There is no technical reason for this either - blank space has no meaning in html; however, this also makes it easier to scan the code quickly - which is particularly helpful when you run into errors! </li>
    </ul>
