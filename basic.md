# Basic Template for HTML

Below is a basic template for an empty HTML Document. 

HTML documents start with a DOCTYPE declaration that states what version of HTML is being used, which tells the browser how the read the code below it to render the page. If the webpage were written with a different coding language, it would tell you here.

After the DOCTYPE, we see the start of the root element. EVERYTHING - all content - that you want presented on this page goes in the root element. 

The root element begins by indicating which language the document is written in. Within the root element of the basic template below, you'll notice the two main sections of all HTML documents - a head section and a body section. 

The head section contains basic information about the file such as the title, keywords, authors, a short description, etc. This is also where you will add your CSS Stylesheet at the end of this workshop. 

The body section contains the content of the page including paragraphs, images, links, and more and indicates how this content is to be structured on the page. 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
</head>

<body>
</body>

</html>
```

ACTIVITY: 
Open your text editor, copy and paste this template into your text editor, and save as 'index.html' to a folder on your desktop named 'html_css'.

Open a second file, copy and paste this same template into your text editor, and save as 'about.html' to the same folder on your desktop.

Once you have both documents saved, open the 'index.html' through the Finder. What happens?
