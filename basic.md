# Basic Template for HTML

Below is a basic template for an empty HTML Document. 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
</head>

<body>
</body>

</html>
```

HTML documents start with a `DOCTYPE` declaration that states what version of HTML is being used, which tells the browser how the read the code below it to render the page. If the webpage were written with a different markup language (i.e. XML, XHTML), it would tell you here.

After the `DOCTYPE`, we see the start of the **Root Element**. EVERYTHING - all content - that you want presented on this page and all information about how you want that information to be organized and styled goes in the root element, and it is demarcated by `<html>` and `</html>`. 

The root element begins by indicating which language the document is written in; and in this basic template, `en` tells us we are writing in English. 

Within the root element of the basic template below, you'll notice the two main sections of all HTML documents - a head section (demarcated by `<head>` and `</head>`) and a body section (demarcated by `<body>` and `</body>`). 

The **head section** contains basic information about the file such as the title, keywords, authors, a short description, etc. This is also where you will link to your CSS Stylesheet. 

The **body section** contains the content of the page including paragraphs, images, links, and more, and indicates how this content is to be structured on the page. 

## ACTIVITY: 
Create a folder called `html_css` on your desktop.

Open your text editor, type or copy and paste the template above into your text editor, and save as `index.html` to the `html_css` folder you just created.

Open a second file, type or copy and paste this same template into your text editor, and save as `about.html` to the same folder on your desktop.

These are the first two pages of your new website! 

*Note: The `index.html` is your default homepage. This is an industry standard, because web browsers tend to recognize the `index.html` page as the opening page to the directory that is your website.* See [Resources](resource.md) for more.

Once you have both documents saved, open the `index.html` through the Finder.
